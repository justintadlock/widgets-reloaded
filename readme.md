# Widgets Reloaded

The default WordPress widgets don't offer much control over how they are output on the screen.  Widgets Reloaded seeks to correct this problem.

This plugin provides alternatives to many of the default widgets with versions that allow much more control.  Widgets come with numerous options to output widget content just like you want.

## Available widgets

The plugin creates the following widgets:

* Reloaded - Archives
* Reloaded - Authors
* Reloaded - Bookmarks _(if link manager is enabled)_
* Reloaded - Calendar
* Reloaded - Categories
* Reloaded - Menu
* Reloaded - Pages
* Reloaded - Posts
* Reloaded - Tags
